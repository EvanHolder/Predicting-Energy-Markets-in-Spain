# Background
Energy markets are especially volatile. At a high level, energy prices are the result of a supply and demand curve. Demand is mostly impacted by the weather outside (seasonal). Supply can be impacted by a multiude of factors from the availability of generation resources, to politics, to international trade and service outages.  Transmission Service Operators (TSOs) are in charge of regulating this supply and demand curve and ensuring a fair market price for both generators and consumers.  It is their job balance the flow of electricity from generating sources with the demand of millions of consumers at every moment, of every day.  Maintaining this supply/demand balance is critical in efficient delivery of electricity.  If electricity generation is too high, generators have to reduce production or be completely disconnect from the grid resulting in wasted resources. If demand is higher than generation, transmission companies are forced to "shed" load resulting brownouts or blackouts for consumers.  Not only is fine-tuning this balance critical in consistent delivery of electricity, but also in keeping electricity prices low. The better TSOs are able to balance supply and demand, the cheaper it is for generators to produces electricity, and the cheaper it is for consumers to purchase it.  

# Business Problem
With the rise renewable energies, which are significantly impacted by the weather, it has become harder to balance energy supply and demand and keep the grid stable.  Grid instability often results in price uncertainty. By more accurately modeling the price of electricity, we can minimize the effects of a rapidly changing supply and demand balance. Or in other words, the better TSO's can model the price of electricity, the better they can regulate energy production, limit wasted resources, and more efficiently deliver electricity to the consumer.
# Data
The data for this project focuses on the electricity market in Spain Generation, transmission, and load data were sourced from the [entso-e Transparency Platform](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/dashboard/show). Weather data was scraped from [wunderground.com](wunderground.com). All electrical price data was retrieved from the Spanish TSO [Red Electric Espana](https://www.esios.ree.es/en/market-and-prices).
